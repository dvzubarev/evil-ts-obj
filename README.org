#+title: treesit text objects and movement for evil



This package is in the development stage and it requires latest builds of Emacs 30.0.50,
since it is based on the thing machinery implemented in the the latest Emacs version.

The goal of this package is not to create text objects for every possible code structure.
Instead, the package provides universal text objects that can be used on code structures of the same type.
For example, there are no distinct text objects for loops and conditionals,
but there is one that you can use on any compound structures like functions, loops, conditionals etc.
Of course, one can add its own text objects, see customization section.
When it comes to movement, this package does not try to extend or enrich the existing movement commands.
It provides opinionated set of movement commands that I find useful in day to day work.

Key features:
- Few text objects, but they allow to operate on many code structures ([[docs/things-demo.org][examples]])
- Set of movement commands
- Set of edit commands/operators ([[docs/edit-demo.org][examples]])
- Support of remote text objects using avy ([[docs/avy-demo.org][examples]])

- Expand region by repeating selection of the same text object
- Easy customization of existing language settings

* Installation
** Emacs and tree-sitter installation
Firstly, install tree-sitter library.
You have to use fairly recent version that is not released yet (specifically the version after 6d1904c221d15d2fcbe0b590ff0a3f96c692429f).
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter.git
cd tree-sitter
git checkout 660481dbf71413eba5a928b0b0ab8da50c1109e0
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
#+end_src

Install Emacs 30.0.50 from sources.
#+begin_src bash
git clone --no-tags --single-branch --filter=blob:none  https://github.com/mirrors/emacs.git emacs-30
cd emacs-30
git checkout b37676642679a9ec3cd3b995cd14a4af3567cf80
./configure --with-tree-sitter --add-flags-to-your-liking
make
sudo make install
#+end_src

More information about installing tree-sitter library and Emacs from sources see in this [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter#building-emacs-with-tree-sitter-support][post]].
** Package installation
An example using straight package manager:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package evil-ts-obj
  :straight (evil-ts-obj :type git :host github :repo "dvzubarev/evil-ts-obj")
  :config
  (add-hook 'python-ts-mode-hook #'evil-ts-obj-mode))
#+end_src

If you don't use straight, you have to clone repository, generate autoloads and optionally compile the project.
One way to do it is to use [[https://github.com/emacs-eldev/eldev#installation][Eldev]].
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/dvzubarev/evil-ts-obj
cd evil-ts-obj
eldev build
eldev compile
#+end_src
After that you can load this package with =use-package=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package evil-ts-obj
  :load-path "/path/to/evil-ts-obj/evil-ts-obj/lisp"
  :init
  (load "/path/to/evil-ts-obj/lisp/evil-ts-obj-autoloads.el")
  :defer t
  :config
  (add-hook 'python-ts-mode-hook #'evil-ts-obj-mode))
#+end_src

You also have to compile grammars for languages that you want to use this library with.
You can use third-party packages like [[https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto][treesit-auto]] or install grammars [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter#installing-the-language-grammars][manually]].

*** Package dependencies

* Supported languages
If you want to enable this package for any supported language,
add =evil-ts-obj-mode= to its hook.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'python-ts-mode-hook #'evil-ts-obj-mode)
(add-hook 'nix-mode-hook #'evil-ts-obj-mode)
#+end_src

- python
- bash
- c++
- nix
- yaml


* Usage

** Defined things

There are a number of things defined in this library:
| Thing     | Description                                                                                                         | Key |
|-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----|
| compound  | Code structures that may enclose @@html:<br>@@ multiple statements/expressions (function, loops, conditionals etc.) | e   |
| statement | Simple statements/expressions, boolean conditions, etc.                                                             | s   |
| parameter | Parameters/arguments of a function, items of a list/mapping/tuples                                                  | a   |

For more information about treesit things see description of =treesit-thing-settings= variable.

** Thing modifiers
Modifiers are used to alter the bounds of a thing, for example, by including next separator or a whitespace.
Modifiers behavior depend on the specific thing.
The implemented modifiers are:

| Modifier | Description                                                   | Key |
|----------+---------------------------------------------------------------+-----|
| outer    | May extend thing bounds to the next or previous sibling       | a   |
| inner    | May shrink thing bounds                                       | i   |
| upper    | Select a thing under point and also all its previous siblings | u   |
| UPPER    | The same as upper + extends to the next sibling               | U   |
| lower    | Select a thing under point and also all its next siblings     | o   |
| LOWER    | The same as lower + extends to the previous sibling           | O   |

** Text objects

See examples in the [[docs/things-demo.org][file]].

Combination of modifiers with things produces set of text objects, that you can use with any evil operator (e.g. =yie=, =doa=).
- (*outer*, *compound*) - thing without changes
- (*inner*, *compound*) - selects only nested statements
- (*outer*, *statement*) - bounds may be extended to the next sibling, if known
  separator is adjacent to the current thing.
  If the current thing is the last statement and there is know separator before it,
  bounds are extended to the previous sibling.
- (*inner*, *statement*) - thing without changes.
- (*outer*, *param*) - bounds are extended to the next sibling or to the closing parenthesis.
   If this is the last parameter, bounds are extended to the previous sibling or to the opening parenthesis.
- (*inner*, *param*) - thing without changes.
- (*upper*, *_*) - given the thing under point; its left bound is determined by the furthest previous sibling.
- (*UPPER*, *_*) - the same as upper, but right bound is extended to the next sibling.
- (*lower*, *_*) - given the thing under point; right bound is determined by the furthest next sibling
- (*LOWER*, *_*) - the same as lower, but left bound is extended to the previous sibling

The described behavior may differ from language to language.
It is just common conventions that one should try to follow, when creating settings for a language.

*** Special text objects
**** Last text object
There is special text object that stores last modified range (=evil-ts-obj-last-text-obj=).
It may be useful in combination with edit operators.
For example, after executing extract operator extracted text may be accessed via last text object.


** Movement
Currently movement commands are using only things as is, without applying modifiers listed above.
Commands, listed belowe, use a group of things, defined in the =evil-ts-obj-conf-nav-things= variable.
This variable is set for every language and for most languages it equals to =(or param statement compound)=.
It means, the commands move point to the nearest thing from this list,
firstly searching for parameters, then statements and so on.

| Command                     | Description                                                                                                                                      | Key   |
|-----------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------|
| beginning-of                | Move to the beginning of the current thing. @@html:<br>@@ When the point is already at the beginning, move to the beginning of the parent thing. | M-a   |
| end-of                      | Move to the end of the current thing. @@html:<br>@@ When the point is already at the end, move to the end of the parent thing.                   | M-e   |
| next-thing                  | Move to the next thing                                                                                                                           | M-f   |
| previous-thing              | Move to the previous thing                                                                                                                       | M-b   |
| same-next-thing             | Detect current thing at point and @@html:<br>@@ move to the next thing of the same type                                                          | C-M-f |
| same-previous-thing         | Detect current thing at point and @@html:<br>@@ move to the previous thing of the same type                                                      | C-M-b |
| next-largest-thing          | Move to the next thing that starts after the end of the current thing                                                                            | M-n   |
| previous-largest-thing      | Move to the previous thing that ends before the start of the current thing                                                                       | M-p   |
| same-next-largest-thing     | Detect current thing at point and @@html:<br>@@ perform next-largest-thing on this thing                                                         | C-M-n |
| same-previous-largest-thing | Detect current thing at point and @@html:<br>@@ perform previous-largest-thing on this thing                                                     | C-M-p |

There are also movement commands for each thing.
They are bound to its own prefixes.

| Command                | Prefix key |
|------------------------+------------|
| beginning-of           | (          |
| end-of                 | )          |
| next-thing             | ]          |
| previous-thing         | [          |
| next-largest-thing     | }          |
| previous-largest-thing | {          |
** Evil operators
There are set of operators for editing text objects. There are DWIM commands
that do not require user inputs, operators that expect one text object and
operators that should be provided with two text objects in a row. Nearly all
DWIM commands have some use for numeric argument.
See examples in the [[docs/edit-demo.org][file]].


- drag-{down,up} ::
  Commands: =evil-ts-obj-drag-down=, =evil-ts-obj-drag-up=

  Swap a current text object with the previous/next sibling.
  When numeric argument is provided, swap current text object with
  the Nth sibling.

  Default keys: =M-j=, =M-k=

- raise ::
  Dwim command: =evil-ts-obj-raise-dwim=

  Replace parent text object with the current text object.
  When numeric argument is set replace Nth parent.

  Default key: =M-r=

  Operator: =evil-ts-obj-raise=

  Replace parent text object with the content from provided text object.

  Default keys: =zr=

- clone-{before,after} ::
  Commands: =evil-ts-obj-clone-before-dwim=, =evil-ts-obj-clone-after-dwim=

  Clone current text object at point and paste it before/after the current one.

  Default keys: =M-C=, =M-c=

- extract-{down,up} ::
  Also known as =move-{right,left}= in lispy.

  Dwim commands: =evil-ts-obj-extract-down-dwim=, =evil-ts-obj-extract-up-dwim=

  Teleport current text object after/before parent text object.
  When numeric argument is set select Nth parent.

  Default keys: =M-l=, =M-h=

  Operators: =evil-ts-obj-extract-down=, =evil-ts-obj-extract-up=

  Teleport provided text object after/before parent text object.

  Default keys: =ze=, =zE=

- inject-{down,up} ::
  Also known as =lispy-{down,up}-slurp= in lispy.

  Dwim Commands: =evil-ts-obj-inject-down-dwim=, =evil-ts-obj-inject-up-dwim=

  Teleport current text object inside next/previous text object.
  Usually inner compounds are used as place for injection.
  When numeric argument is set select N-1th child of next/previous text object.

  Default keys: =M-s=, =M-S=

  Operators: =evil-ts-obj-inject-down=, =evil-ts-obj-inject-up=

  Teleport provided text object inside next/previous text object.

- slurp ::
  Command: =evil-ts-obj-slurp=

  Extend current compound with sibling statements COUNT times.
  Count is provided via numeric argument.
  When point is inside the compound or at the end of compound slurp lower statements.
  If point is at the beginning slurp upper statements.

  Default key: =M->=

- barf ::
  Command: =evil-ts-obj-barf=

  Shrink current compound extracting inner statements COUNT times.
  Count is provided via numeric argument.
  When point is inside the compound or at the end of the compound
  barf bottommost statements. If point is at the beginning barf
  topmost statments.

  Default key: =M-<=

- low-level operators ::
  These operators expect that user provide two text objects in a row (inspired by evil-exchange).

  Operators:
  - =evil-ts-obj-swap= (=zx=)
  - =evil-ts-obj-replace= (=zR=)
  - =evil-ts-obj-clone-after= (=zc=)
  - =evil-ts-obj-teleport-after= (=zt=)
  - =evil-ts-obj-clone-before= (=zC=)
  - =evil-ts-obj-teleport-before= (=zT=)

** Selecting overlapping things

The common case is when multiple things start at the same position.
It can lead to ambiguity, especially if the things are of the same type,
or one uses movement commands that selecting next/previous things based on the current thing at point.
For example:

#+begin_src yaml
- item1
- item2
#+end_src
The first hyphen symbol is the beginning of the list (compound thing) and a list item (param thing).

#+begin_src python
if v is not None and v != 0:
#+end_src
Here the first =v= is the start of the two statement things: whole condition and the first condition (=v is not None=).

When there are multiple overlapping things, the current thing at point depends on the point position.
If the position is before any thing (on the same line),
the largest thing is selected, which starts after the position.
If the position is after any thing (on the same line), the largest thing is selected, which ends before the position.
If the position is inside of any thing, then the smallest enclosing thing is returned.
** Expand region
When using evil visual selection you can expand current selection, when using the same text object multiple times.
For example, pressing =vaeae= will select the whole function.
#+begin_src python
def func():
    while True:
        |pass
#+end_src

** Avy integration
By default, avy prefix keybinding is =z=.
Avy allows you to jump to any thing that is currently visible on the screen (try =zie=).
Moreover you can apply any evil operator to the remote thing (e.g. =dzae=).
It also works across multiple windows.

See examples in the [[docs/avy-demo.org][file]].

*** Custom avy actions
You can press a special key before selecting avy candidates,
to perform some predefined action on it.
Those actions are implemented in this package:

|                 | Description                                                                                                            | Key |
|-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----|
| paste-after     | Paste selected thing behind the point. @@html:<br>@@ Special care is taken to adapt indentation of the inserted thing. | p   |
| paste-before    | Paste selected thing before the cursor position.                                                                       | P   |
| teleport-after  | Cut selected thing and paste it behind the point.                                                                      | m   |
| teleport-before | Cut selected thing and paste it before the cursor position.                                                            | M   |
| delete          | Delete selected thing                                                                                                  | x   |
| yank            | Yank selected thing                                                                                                    | y   |

See examples in the [[docs/avy-demo.org][file]].

For someone who finds it inconvenient to press action key before selection,
there exist standalone functions for starting paste action.
Check =evil-ts-obj-avy-compound-outer-paste-after=, =evil-ts-obj-avy-compound-outer-teleport-after= commands
and also corresponding keymaps: =evil-ts-obj-avy-inner-paste-map=, =evil-ts-obj-avy-outer-paste-map=.


* Customization

** Changing various keybindings
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! evil-ts-obj
  :init

  (setopt evil-ts-obj-navigation-keys-prefix
        '((beginning-of . nil)
          (end-of . nil)
          (previous . "(")
          (next . ")")
          (previous-largest . "{")
          (next-largest . "}")))

  (setopt evil-ts-obj-avy-key-prefix "C-j")

  (setopt evil-ts-obj-compound-thing-key "d")
  :config

  (evil-define-key 'normal 'evil-ts-obj-mode
    (kbd "M-a") nil
    (kbd "C-M-a") #'evil-ts-obj-beginning-of-thing))
#+end_src

** Add things and text objects
For example, you want to add its own thing for a function in python.

Basic configuration:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! evil-ts-obj
  :config

  (add-to-list 'evil-ts-obj-python-things '(func "function_definition"))

  (evil-ts-obj-define-text-obj func outer)
  (keymap-set evil-ts-obj-outer-text-objects-map "F" #'evil-ts-obj-func-outer)
  ;to setup everything at once
  ;(evil-ts-obj-setup-all-text-objects func "F")

  ;; bind all movement commands to key f
  (evil-ts-obj-setup-all-movement func "f")

  ;optional modifiers of a new thing
  (setq evil-ts-obj-python-ext-func #'my-python-ext))

(defun my-python-ext (spec node)
  (pcase spec
    ;; create inner text object
    ((pmap (:thing 'func) (:mod 'inner))
     (evil-ts-obj-python-extract-compound-inner node))
    ;jump on the function name for every movement command
    ((pmap (:thing 'func) (:act 'nav))
     (when-let ((name-node (treesit-node-child-by-field-name node "name")))
       (list (treesit-node-start name-node)
             (treesit-node-end node))))
    (_
     (evil-ts-obj-python-ext spec node))))
#+end_src

* Add a new language
See basic [[examples/evil-ts-obj-basic-python.el][example]] for python or [[lisp/evil-ts-obj-yaml.el][yaml]] settings to get started.
Check out other setting files that are in a repository for a little bit more advanced configurations.

* Development
For running tests you have to install [[https://github.com/emacs-eldev/eldev][Eldev]].
When running tests one should pass the path to the directory containing grammars for all testing languages.
#+begin_src bash
eldev -S '(setq treesit-extra-load-path (list "/path/to/tree-sitter/grammars"))' test
#+end_src

* Alternatives and Inspirations
There are packages that are more mature and support more languages:
- [[https://github.com/mickeynp/combobulate][combobulate]] has many feature. Make sure to check it out!
- [[https://github.com/meain/evil-textobj-tree-sitter][evil-textobj-tree-sitter]] supports many more languages and works with the older Emacs versions.

Remote text objects were inspired by the great packages [[https://github.com/noctuid/targets.el][targets.el]], [[https://github.com/noctuid/things.el][things.el]].
